# Player Statistics Tracker

This Streamlit application allows users to track and analyze player performance in a competitive gaming environment. The app enables data entry for match details, visualization of match records, and generation of aggregated player statistics based on Average Combat Score (ACS), kill/death (K/D) ratio, and other key performance indicators.

## Features

1. **Add Match Details:** 
   - Enter player information, match outcomes, and stats for detailed tracking.
   - Select from pre-defined values for Map, Agent, and Rank.

2. **Delete Records:**
   - Remove any match records from the database as needed.

3. **Display Match Details:**
   - View all stored match details in a clean, tabular format.

4. **Aggregate Player Statistics:**
   - Aggregates data by player name to show averages for ACS, Econ Rating, total Kills, Deaths, Assists, and K/D Ratio.
   - Display ranked players based on Average ACS for quick comparisons.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/debduthira/Valorant-Player-Ranking-System.git
